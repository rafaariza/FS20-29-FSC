    \begin{itemize}
        \thusitem Python \emoji{blue-heart} Computational cosmology
        \thusitem FFT and random numbers are essential in this simulation approach
        \thusitem For \(\symrm{P}_0(k)\):
        \begin{itemize}[label=\filledcircle]
            \item Large fluctuations for \(n_s<0\)
            \item Small fluctuations for \(n_s>1\)
            \item Harrison-Zel'dovich \((n_s=1)\) homogeneous fluctuations at large scales with noticeable fluctuations at smaller scales
        \end{itemize}
        \thusitem With \(T(k)\) we reproduced the spatial distribution of fluctuations in the CMB
        \thusitem 2D and 3D realizations were useful for the comprehension
    \end{itemize}

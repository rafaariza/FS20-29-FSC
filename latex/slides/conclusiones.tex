    \begin{itemize}
        \thusitem Python \emoji{blue-heart} Computational cosmology.
        \thusitem FFT and random numbers are essential in this simulation approach.
        \thusitem For \(\symrm{P}_0(k)\):
        \begin{itemize}[label=\filledcircle]
            \item Large scale fluctuations for \(n_s<0\).
            \item Small scale fluctuations for \(n_s>0\).
            \item Harrison-Zel'dovich \((n_s=1)\) homogeneous fluctuations at large scales with noticeable fluctuations at smaller scales.
        \end{itemize}
        \thusitem With \(T(k)\) we reproduce the spatial distribution of fluctuations in the CMB.
        \thusitem 2D and 3D realizations are essential for the comprehension.
    \end{itemize}

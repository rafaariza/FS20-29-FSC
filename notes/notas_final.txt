-CMB-
The CMB contains tiny variations in its intensity
(as a function of direction on the sky) that reflect perturbations in the density
of matter in the early universe. The pattern of these fluctuations contains critical
information about the primordial universe. More than any other cosmological probe,
the study of the CMB anisotropies has transformed cosmology into a precision
science.
The correlations observed in the
afterglow of the Big Bang were inherited from the correlations of the quantum
fluctuations during inflation.

-SPECTRUM-
inflation predicts fluctuations that are naturally close to scale invariant because the inflationary dynamics is approximately time-translation invariant.
However, we also know that inflation must end, so there has to be a small time
dependence in the evolution. This translates into a small deviation from a perfectly
scale-invariant spectrum.
